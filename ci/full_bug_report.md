# Full Bug Report

## Overview
A technical scan was executed across the repository focusing on lint
errors, unit tests and code health. The following issues were found and
addressed:

## Detected Issues
- **Duplicate function definition** in `user_interface.py` where
  `_load_pyrebase` was declared twice, leading to `F811` warnings during
  linting.
- **Missing Python dependencies** (`requests`, `psutil`, `tkhtmlview`,
  `beautifulsoup4`, `pytest-mock`) prevented test collection.

## Applied Fixes
- Removed the redundant `_load_pyrebase` definition and unified the
  docstring to avoid redefinition and maintain clear documentation.
- Installed required dependencies so that the test suite could run.

## Remaining Notes
- `flake8` reports many style issues across the project such as long
  lines and unused imports. These were not addressed in this pass.

All tests pass after fixes.
