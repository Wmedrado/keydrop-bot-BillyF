# Codex Instructions

Before making any modifications to the repository, agents must read all files in
`docs/` and `REQUISITOS DA APLICAÇÃO/` to understand the business rules and
functional requirements. Changes that violate these documented rules should be
avoided. The documentation in `docs/` describes the purpose of each module and
its key functions. Always consult it first when implementing new features or
refactoring existing code.
